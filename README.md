# Digit-Recognizer-using-ensemble-method-in-Convolutional Neural Network
In this notebook, I have used the ensemble method using a Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for digit recognition trained on the famous MNIST dataset. I chose to build it with Keras API (Tensorflow backend) which is very intuitive. Firstly, I will prepare the dataset (handwritten digit images), then I will focus on the CNN modeling and evaluation.

## This Notebook has three main parts:

- The data preparation.
- The CNN modeling and evaluation.
- The results prediction and submission.

## Performance: Accuracy: 0.9947, Loss: 0.0321
