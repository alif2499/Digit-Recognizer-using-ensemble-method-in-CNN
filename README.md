# Digit-Recognizer-using-ensemble-method-in-CNN
In this version of my notebook, I have used the ensemble method using Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for digits recognition trained on MNIST dataset. I choosed to build it with keras API (Tensorflow backend) which is very intuitive. Firstly, I will prepare the data (handwritten digits images) then i will focus on the CNN modeling and evaluation.
